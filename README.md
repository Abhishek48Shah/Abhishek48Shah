# Abhishek Shah

**Loadingâ€¦**  

Welcome to my little corner of the coding universe.  
Just a guy from the **terminal kingdom** (Arch user, obviously), wielding my **Node.js sword** and **Express body armor** in the backend battles.  

Sometimes I peek into the **systems world with my C cannon**. Still learning, still experimenting, still breaking things (the good way).  

I spend more time in the terminal than the GUI, because thatâ€™s where magic happens.

And yesâ€¦ Iâ€™m basically the **god of my own world** 

---

**Fun Fact:**    
- I write scripts that actually do stuff.  
- Iâ€™m constantly exploring, testing, failing, and leveling up.  

---

**Currently Playing With:**  
- Node.js & Express (backend adventures)  
- Bash, Linux utilities, and small system-level experiments
