# Abhishek Shah

Just a guy obsessed with coding, teaching myself new stuff, and diving deep into the **backend**.  

I love building things that actually **do stuff**—applications, scripts, and everything in between.  

And yeah… I’m basically a **god in my own world**. 🌌 
## ⚡ Skills & Interests
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **System Programming:** Getting into the systems world with C, Bash, Linux (BTW **ARCH**)
- **Self-learning machine:** Constantly experimenting and breaking things (the good way!) and spend time in terminal rather then GUI
