# Abhishek Shah

Just a guy obsessed with coding, teaching myself new stuff, and diving deep into the **backend and system-level universe**.  

I love building things that actually **do stuff**â€”applications, scripts, and everything in between.  

And yeahâ€¦ Iâ€™m basically a **god in my own world**. ðŸŒŒ 
## âš¡ Skills & Interests
- **Backend & System Programming:** C, Bash, JS, Node, Linux magic
- **Self-learning machine:** Constantly experimenting and breaking things (the good way!)
