# Abhishek Shah

Just a guy obsessed with coding, teaching myself new stuff, and diving deep into the **backend**.  

I love building things that actually **do stuff**â€”applications, scripts, and everything in between.  

And yeahâ€¦ Iâ€™m basically a **god in my own world**. ðŸŒŒ 
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **System Programming:** Getting into the systems world with C, Bash, Linux (BTW **ARCH**)
- **spend time in terminal rather than GUI**
